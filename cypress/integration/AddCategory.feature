Feature: Add a category

    To create a new note, the user should have the ability to decide if he wants to have a category on that new note or not.
    To add a category, the user has two options, where he can either select a category from an already existing list, 
    or he can add a new category manually, in case it doesn't have the category the user wants.
    There's also the option for the user to create a new note with no category.
    The category will be visible in the list of items (notes).
